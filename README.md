# Code Challenges

My collection of coding challenges and algorithm implementations, organized by topic and source. It is intended as a resource for practicing data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving skills, from platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/horia-delicoti/) and [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/c532381g1/).

## Folders

- **algorithms**: Classic algorithm implementations, including searching, sorting, and two-pointer techniques.
- **data_structure**: Implementations of fundamental data structures such as linked lists and queues.
- **geekforgeek**: Solutions to problems from GeeksforGeeks, organized by topic.
- **leetcode**: Solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by topic.

## Topics

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, selection sort.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear search, binary search.
- **Two Pointer Techniques**: Opposite direction and same direction approaches for array problems.
- **Data Structures**: Linked lists, queues, hash tables, and more.
