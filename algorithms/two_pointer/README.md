# Two Pointer

The two-pointer technique is a commmon algorithm  approach used in solving array or list problems.

## Opposite Direction Technique

In this approach, the two pointers start at opposite ends of the array (one at the beginning and one at the end) and move towards each other. This is particularly useful for problems that involve comparing or summing pairs of elements.

- Two-Sum Problem in a Sorted Array: Finding two numbers in a sorted array that sum up to a specific target.
- Palindrome Checking: Verifying if a string is a palindrome.
- Container with Most Water: Finding the maximum area of water that can be contained by two vertical lines on a coordinate plane.

## Same Direction Technique

In this approach, both pointers start at the same end of the array and move through the array at different speeds or step sizes. This is useful for problems that involve finding subarrays, subsequences, or specific conditions within a single pass through the array.

- Sliding Window Problems: Finding the maximum/minimum sum of a subarray of a fixed size.
- Removing Duplicates: Removing duplicates from a sorted array in place.
- Partitioning Arrays: Segregating elements based on a condition, such as even and odd numbers.
